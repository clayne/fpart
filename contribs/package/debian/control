Description: sort file trees and pack them into bags
 Fpart is a tool that helps you sort file trees and pack them into bags (called
 "partitions"). It is developed in C and available under the BSD license.
 .
 It splits a list of directories and file trees into a certain number of
 partitions, trying to produce partitions with the same size and number of
 files.
 It can also produce partitions with a given number of files or a limited size.
 Once generated, partitions are either printed as file lists to stdout
 (default) or to files. Those lists can then be used by third party programs.
 .
 Fpart also includes a live mode, which allows it to crawl very large
 filesystems and produce partitions in live. Hooks are available to act on
 those partitions  (e.g. immediately start a transfer using rsync(1), cpio(1),
 pax(1) or tar(1)) without having to wait for the filesystem traversal job to
 be finished. Used this way, fpart can be seen as a powerful data migration
 tool.
